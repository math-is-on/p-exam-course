  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we'll go over some of the basics such as "Defin(ing) set functions, Venn diagrams, sample space, and events. Define probability as a set 
      function on a collection of events and state the basic axioms of probability." which is taken from the syllabus
      for the P exam.

    <title>Basic Principles of Counting</title>
    <p>Before we talk about probability, we need to first talk about the science of <em>counting</em>, also called <em>Combinatorial Analysis.</em>

    Let's start with the basic principle of counting:</p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-basic-counting">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose you can perform one task in <m>m</m> ways for each of those <m>m</m> outcomes, you can perform another
          task in <m>n</m> ways.  Then the number of ways you can perform these tasks together is <me>mn</me> ways.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    
    <example>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose I own 20 different shirts and 13 different pairs of pants.  How many different outfits can I create from these options?
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>

      <answer>
        <p>
          I can pick a shirt in 20 ways, and a pair of pants in 13 ways, so by the basic principle of counting, I can choose an outfit in <m>20 \cdot 13 = 260</m> ways.
        </p>
      </answer>
